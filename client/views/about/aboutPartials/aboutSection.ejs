project aims at providing fast and reliable ambulance service through a wide network of hospitals and
ambulance providers brought under one roof. The alarming number of deaths of accident victims due to

ambulances, real time monitoring of bed availability in hospitals, patient tracking, simplified

                     Many people are unaware of the fine which
the ambulance provider working under 108/102 needs to submit a fine if the van doesnâ€™t reach within 20
minutes in urban areas. The prime objective is to reduce the response time of emergency services thus
making them faster and better.
